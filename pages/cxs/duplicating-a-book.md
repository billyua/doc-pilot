CX Studio lets you duplicate books created by you or by other users.

The duplicated book may look different than the original because dashboards prevented from sharing may become inaccessible in the new book. The table below lets you know whether you can copy a dashboard from one book to another.

| DO YOU OWN A DASHBOARD? | IS IT PREVENTED FROM SHARING? | CAN YOU DUPLICATE IT? |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Yes | Yes | Yes |
| No | No | Yes |
| No | Yes | No |

## To duplicate a book

1. Open Dashboard Explorer and locate the book you wish to copy.

1. Expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="icon-actions.png" %} next to it and select **Duplicate**.

CX Studio then creates a copy of the book with an indexed "Copy" suffix appended to its name. If any dashboard becomes inaccessible during copying, a corresponding tab remains in the book, but no widgets are shown.
