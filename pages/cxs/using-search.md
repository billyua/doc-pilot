When in Dashboard Explorer, you can find a particular dashboard or book using any of the following methods:

* Look through the dashboards and books you viewed recently using the RECENT tab.

* Quickly access your [favorite dashboards and books][adding-to-favorites] using the FAVORITES tab.

* Find a dashboard or book by name using the search field in the ALL DASHBOARDS section.

   {% include tip.html content="Type the word **dashboards** into the search field to display just the dashboards to which you have access (regardless of whether the word *dashboards* is in their name). Type the word **books** to display just the books." %}

* Sort objects by name, date modified, author, or view count by clicking the corresponding column headers. Click a header several times to switch between ascending and descending sorting.
