You can add a dashboard or book to favorites so you can quickly access it from the FAVORITES tab of Dashboard Explorer.

To add an object to favorites, simply click the star icon next to its name (the star will turn dark {% include inline_image.html file="icon-favorite.png" %}).

To remove an object from favorites, click its star icon one more time (the star will become clear again {% include inline_image.html file="icon-favorite-clear.png" %}).
