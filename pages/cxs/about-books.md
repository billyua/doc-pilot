Books, or tabbed dashboards, let you combine up to 20 different dashboards into a single "package." Books recreate a browser-like experience, allowing users to switch between related dashboards easily and quickly without having to go back to the Dashboard Explorer.

You can add a single dashboard to multiple books, and changes you make to that dashboard will be reflected in every book it is included in. This is a great way to mix and match existing dashboards into different books for different audiences.
