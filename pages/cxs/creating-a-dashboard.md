CX Studio lets you create any number of dashboards for different business needs.

{% include note.html content="Note: A [Create Dashboard][permissions] permission is required to perform this action." %}

To create a dashboard

1. Start by opening the Dashboard Explorer.

   You can do this by clicking the CX Studio logo in the top left corner.

1. Once in the Dashboard Explorer, click the **New Dashboard** button in the ALL DASHBOARDS area.

   To create a dashboard inside a specific folder, expand the actions menu next to that folder and select **Create Dashboard**.

   Alternatively, you can [copy another dashboard][duplicating-a-dashboard].

1. The Dashboard Templates window features predefined templates designed to help you get started with your new dashboard.

   To create a blank (empty) dashboard, select the Blank template.

   To use a preset template, select it here. See [Using Dashboard Templates][dashboard-templates].

1. Provide a title and a description for your dashboard.

   {% include note.html content="Dashboard title must be unique per user per Master Account." %}

1. Choose if you wish to use dashboard optimization as described in [Dashboard Properties][dashboard-properties].

1. Select the default Content Provider instance, account, and project as described in [Dashboard Properties][dashboard-properties].

   {% include tip.html content="You can have these preselected with your favorites if you set them in [user preferences][user-preferences]." %}

1. Select **Enable Personalization** and pick a user if you wish to [personalize your dashboard][personalizing-a-dashboard].

1. Select **Prevent Editors from Sharing** if you do not want anyone else to be able to share this dashboard individually or as part of a book.

1. **Save** when ready.

After you click **Save**, an empty dashboard is created in the root folder of the Dashboard Explorer. It immediately opens in the [Edit mode][editing-a-dashboard].

You can then perform the following actions:

* [Add widgets to your dashboard][adding-a-widget]
* [Share your dashboard with others][sharing-a-dashboard]
* [Personalize your dashboard][personalizing-a-dashboard]
* [Move your dashboard to a folder][moving-to-a-folder]
* [Organize your dashboards into books][about-books]
