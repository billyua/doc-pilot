You can run a dashboard or book in Command Center mode, which is especially useful if you wish to broadcast the CX situation on a large screen in the office or at company events.

Running a dashboard or book in Command Center mode means the following:

* Dashboard or book runs in full screen mode.

* The header is minimized and navigation options are hidden. Book tabs remain visible and can be used in full screen mode.

* Reports are refreshed automatically using a customizable schedule.

* CX Studio does not time out.

To run a dashboard or book in Command Center mode, open it in View mode and click the **Toggle full screen mode** button {% include inline_image.html file="command-center-button.png" %} in the header.

{% include tip.html content="For security purposes, we recommend running Command Center mode by a user with [CX Studio Basic license][license-types] (don't forget to [share the dashboard][sharing-a-dashboard] or [book][sharing-a-book] with this user)." %}

Once a dashboard or book is in Command Center mode, you can choose the refresh interval for reporting widgets from the drop-down list in the header. You can set the reports to refresh every 5, 10, 30, or 60 minutes.

{% include note.html content="Regular [scheduled refreshes][scheduling-a-dashboard-refresh] are ignored in Command Center mode." %}

To exit a Command Center mode, click the **Toggle full screen mode** button {% include inline_image.html file="command-center-off-button.png" %} one more time, or simply press the Escape key.
{% include links.html %}
