You can permanently delete dashboards you no longer need.

If you delete a dashboard assigned to a book, a corresponding tab will remain inside a book, but the dashboard will no longer be available.

{% include note.html content="You can only delete the dashboards you created. If another user shared a dashboard with you and you no longer need it, they can stop sharing it." %}

## To delete a dashboard

There are several ways of deleting a dashboard:

* When in the Dashboard Explorer, expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="icon-actions.png" %} next to the dashboard you wish to delete and select **Delete Dashboard**.

   If you need to delete several objects, select them using the check boxes on the left. Multiple selections share the same actions menu.

* When a dashboard is open in View mode, expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="dashboard-actions-icon.png" %} in the dashboard header and select **Delete**.

Click **Continue** to confirm dashboard deletion.
