CX Studio users can rate dashboards and books on a five-star scale. These ratings can help other users find the best dashboards in CX Studio.

Ratings are displayed in Dashboard Explorer and next to the object's title when users view it.

{% include note.html content="Dashboard and book owners cannot rate their own objects." %}

{% include note.html content="Ratings can be disabled on the [Master Account level][enabling-dashboard-ratings]." %}

## To rate an object

1. Open Dashboard Explorer and locate the dashboard or book you wish to rate.

1. Click the current rank in the **Rating** column and vote using the pop-up star selector.
