A **dashboard** is a customizable collection of widgets.

A single dashboard can hold up to 25 reporting widgets and up to 50 content widgets. You can arrange the widgets freely around the dashboard's canvas. We recommend creating separate dashboards for different purposes and target audiences.

In the CX Studio object hierarchy, widgets are organized inside a dashboard, and dashboards can be organized inside a book.
