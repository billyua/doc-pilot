After scheduling a [dashboard refresh][scheduling-a-dashboard-refresh] or a [PDF distribution][scheduling-a-pdf-distribution], you can stop, renew, or remove dashboard schedules.

## To stop a scheduled action

To stop a scheduled action, open the **Dashboard Scheduling** window and either clear the **Enabled** check box in action properties to temporarily disable it or click the **x** button in its header to permanently remove it.

You can also [disable all scheduled runs][viewing-dashboard-schedules] from the **Dashboard Schedules** section.

## To renew a scheduled action

By default all schedules are set to expire automatically six months after the start date. You can click the **Renew** link in schedule settings to postpone its expiration for six more months after the current date.

## To access all scheduled actions

If you scheduled at least one scheduled action, you will be able to access them all in one place by expanding the main menu in the top navigation area and selecting **Dashboard Schedules** from the drop-down menu. See [Viewing Dashboard Schedules][viewing-dashboard-schedules] for details.
