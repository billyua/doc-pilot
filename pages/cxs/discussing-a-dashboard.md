You can discuss a dashboard with other viewers by leaving comments. The **Comments** area can be expanded and collapsed on the right side of a dashboard.

{% include note.html content="Don't forget to share your dashboard with others to let them view reports, leave comments, and be mentioned in dashboard discussions." %}

{% include tip.html content="If you wish to leave inline comments, use the [Text block widget][text-block-widget]." %}
