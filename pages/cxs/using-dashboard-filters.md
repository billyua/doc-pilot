If dashboard filters are not locked, you can change their values in View mode.

Doing so only applies to your current dashboard session and lets you try different filter combinations without affecting other users. Reloading a dashboard resets dashboard filters to their [default values][defining-dashboard-filters].

{% include tip.html content="If you are viewing a book with several dashboards, switching between the book's tabs does not reset filter values." %}

## To modify dashboard-wide filters selections

1. Expand the filters drop-down panel by clicking the filter button next to your dashboard's name.

1. Expand the drop-down list for the filter you wish to modify and select a new filter option.

   {% include note.html content="Locked filter's values cannot be changed in View mode." %}

1. Click **Apply** to apply currently selected filters.

   To cancel your changes and revert to previously applied filters, click **Clear Changes**.

Applied dashboard-wide filters are displayed in the **Filters** section under the dashboard's name and in every widget's filters drop-down in the DASHBOARD FILTERS section.

When multiple elements are selected for any of the filters, they are displayed in a truncated format (**first selection + n more**). To see the full list of selected values, hold the mouse cursor over the filter or expand the filters drop-down panel.
