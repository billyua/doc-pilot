If you do not want certain dashboards or books to appear in Dashboard Explorer, you can hide them.

Hiding an object only affects its visibility in the ALL DASHBOARDS section of your Dashboard Explorer. Hidden objects will still appear in the RECENT and FAVORITES tabs. Moreover, you can access hidden objects by switching their visibility on, as well as unhide these objects altogether.

{% include tip.html content="Alternatively, you can organize dashboards and books into folders. Note that folders cannot be hidden." %}

## To toggle visibility of hidden objects

The visibility of all hidden objects can be switched on and off using the eye toggle button next to the search field:

* {% include inline_image.html file="hidden-hide.png" %} indicates that hidden object are not shown. Click it to show hidden objects.

* {% include inline_image.html file="hidden-show.png" %} indicates that hidden objects are shown. Click it to hide hidden objects.

    Hidden objects are displayed using greyed out colors.

## To hide a dashboard or a book

1. Open Dashboard Explorer and locate the object you wish to hide.

1. If you need to hide several objects, select them using the check boxes on the left. Multiple selections share the same actions menu.

1. Expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="icon-actions.png" %} next to the object and select **Hide**.

Hidden objects will no longer appear in Dashboard Explorer unless the eye toggle button is set to show hidden objects.

## To unhide a dashboard or a book

Once an object is hidden, you can unhide it.

1. Make sure the eye toggle button is set to {% include inline_image.html file="hidden-show.png" %} show hidden objects.

1. Locate the hidden object you wish to unhide.

1. If you need to unhide several objects, select them using the check boxes on the left. Multiple selections share the same actions menu.

1. Expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="icon-actions.png" %} next to the object and select **Show**.
