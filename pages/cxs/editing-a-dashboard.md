After a dashboard is [created][creating-a-dashboard], you can change its properties or modify its widgets.

{% include note.html content="To edit a dashboard, a user must have an [Edit Dashboard][permissions] permission and be granted [Can Edit][sharing-a-dashboard] permission for the specific dashboard." %}

## Switch Between Edit and View Mode

To modify widgets, you need to open the dashboard in Edit mode. There are several ways of doing this:

* When in Dashboard Explorer, expand the actions menu next to a particular dashboard and select **Edit**.
* When viewing a dashboard, click the **Edit** button in the dashboard header.
* When viewing a dashboard inside a book, click the **Edit Dashboard** button in the book header.

To return to View mode, either save or cancel your changes using corresponding buttons at the top.

## Dashboard Auto-Saving

Your dashboard is saved automatically every time you perform the following actions:

* Add a new widget from the menu or via drilling
* Change dashboard title
* [Copy a widget][copying-a-widget]
* [Delete a widget][deleting-a-widget]

## Change Dashboard Properties

To access dashboard properties, open the dashboard, expand the actions menu in the dashboard header and select **Edit Dashboard Properties**.

See [Dashboard Properties][dashboard-properties] to learn more.

{% include tip.html content="In Edit mode, you can quickly change dashboard title in the top left corner without going to the Actions menu." %}
