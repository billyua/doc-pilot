You can create folders to organize dashboards and books in Dashboard Explorer.

To create a folder

1. Open Dashboard Explorer.

1. Once in Dashboard Explorer, click the **New Folder** button in the ALL DASHBOARDS area.

1. Type folder name and description in the **Folder Properties** window and click **Save**.

   {% include note.html content="Folder name must be unique per user." %}

Once the folder is created, you can expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="icon-actions.png" %} next to it and perform the following actions:

* **Create Dashboard.** Create a dashboard inside this folder.

* **Add Subfolder.** Create another folder inside.

* **Rename.** Change folder name or description.

* **Delete Folder.** Delete a folder (without dashboards). See [Deleting a Folder][deleting-a-folder].
