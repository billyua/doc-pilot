You can save a previous version of your dashboard and edit it separately, so you can pursue parallel paths with your dashboards.

{% include note.html content="Saving a dashboard version as a separate dashboard makes no changes to the original dashboard and its versions." %}

{% include note.html content="Unlike copying a dashboard, saving a dashboard version does not change ownership of dashboard's widgets." %}

## To save a dashboard version

1. Open the dashboard that contains a version you wish to save.

1. Expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="dashboard-actions-icon.png" %} in the dashboard header and select **Versions**.

1. Select the version you wish to save in the Versions panel and click the **Save as...** link.

   {% include image.html file="dashboard-versions-save.png" %}

1. Provide a name for the new dashboard and click **Save**.

After you click **Save**, CX Studio creates a new dashboard identical to the version you selected and opens it in Edit mode.
