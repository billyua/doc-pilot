When you open a dashboard in [Edit mode][editing-a-dashboard], and it is already being edited by someone else, both users will be notified about it.

{% include image.html file="dashboard-conflict.png" %}

When several users are editing the same dashboard at the same time, the **last save** will overwrite all previous changes.

This is why we recommend to resolve these situations by starting a conversation either in the Comments area (see [Discussing a Dashboard][discussing-a-dashboard]) or offline.
