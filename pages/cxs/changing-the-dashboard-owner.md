Dashboard owners can reassign their dashboards to other users, giving them full control of the dashboard.

{% include important.html content="Once you reassign dashboard ownership to another user, you will not be able to undo this action. Only the new owner will be able to change dashboard ownership. You will be granted a Can Edit permission to the dashboard you gave away." %}

Dashboard ownership can only be transferred to users who satisfy the following conditions:

* Has [Edit Dashboard][permissions] permission.
* Belongs to the same Master Account as the original dashboard owner.

Similar to [copying a dashboard][duplicating-a-dashboard], changing dashboard ownership also changes ownership of dashboard's widgets.

### To change the dashboard owner

1. Open your dashboard.

1. Expand the actions menu in the dashboard header and select **Edit Dashboard Properties**. This opens the **Dashboard Properties** window.

1. Type the email of the new owner in the **Dashboard Owner** field.

   {% include note.html content="A dashboard cannot be saved if this field is empty." %}

1. Click **Save**.

1. Confirm your action by clicking **Transfer** in the pop-up window.
