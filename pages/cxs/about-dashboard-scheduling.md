As a dashboard owner, you can schedule your dashboard to periodically perform the following actions:

* [Refresh a dashboard][scheduling-a-dashboard-refresh]

   Rerun all of the dashboard's reports using the latest available data from the Content Provider. Scheduled refreshing runs in the background and caches the reports, making them run faster as long as the cache remains valid.

* [Distribute PDF via email][scheduling-a-pdf-distribution]

   Generate a PDF snapshot of the dashboard and email it to a selected group of recipients.
