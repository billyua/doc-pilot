You can permanently delete books you no longer need. Deleting a book **does not** delete dashboards attached to it.

{% include note.html content="You can only delete books you created. If another user shared a book with you and you no longer need it, they can [stop sharing it][sharing-a-book.html#how-to-stop-sharing-a-book]" %}

## To delete a book

There are several ways of deleting a book:

* When in the Dashboard Explorer, expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="icon-actions.png" %} next to the book you wish to delete and select **Delete Book**.

* When viewing a book, expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="dashboard-actions-icon.png" %} in the book header and select **Delete**.

Click **Continue** to confirm book deletion.
