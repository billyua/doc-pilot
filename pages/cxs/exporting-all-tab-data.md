You can export data from all reporting widgets of a current tab to an XLSX file. This export is identical to [exporting all widget data][exporting-all-widgets-to-excel] from a dashboard.

{% include note.html content="Only reporting widgets are exported to XLSX." %}

## To export all tab's widgets

1. Open the book and then go to the tab you wish to export.

1. Expand the actions menu {% include inline_image.html file="dashboard-actions-icon.png" %} in the book header and select **Export All Tab Data**.

1. Save the exported file.

The exported file contains each widget's data in a separate Excel sheet in the order of their appearance on the dashboard.
{% include links.html %}
